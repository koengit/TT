TTG: Type-Theoretical Grammar semantics for GF Resource Grammar

Started by AR 24/2/2017

Try:

  runghc TTG.hs <ex1.txt
  
  runghc TTG.hs <ex2.txt

Functionality:
- parse a text line by line
- build a context with a fresh referent for each line (r0,r1,...)
- translating each sentence to type theory
  - in the context of the previous ones
  - in the local context created by quantifiers


Files:
- Lang.hs         -- Haskell-internal abstract syntax built by Makefile
- Lang.pgf        -- run-time grammar built by Makefile
- Semantics.hs    -- compositional semantics
- TTG.hs          -- the main module


Notice: we assume that all atomic predicates are polymorhic, i.e.
apply to individuals of all types.
